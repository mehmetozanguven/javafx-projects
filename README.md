This repo contains my all example projects about JavaFX.

You can download it each repo independently and run it on your IDE. Or you can create fully jar by running the command `mvn clean install`. After running the maven command look at the folder called **shade** in the project structure then you can run the JavaFX project with `java -jar {name}.jar`
